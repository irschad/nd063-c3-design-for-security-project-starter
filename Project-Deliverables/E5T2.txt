
a. Tools to Scan infrastructure as code templates.
        - CloudSploit  (for scanning CloudFormation templates)
	- Terrascan (for scanning Terraform templates)
	- Checkov (for scanning CloudFormation, Terraform, ARM templates, etc.)

   Example of compliance violations or vulnerabilities:
        - CloudSploit can detect vulnerabilities such as ELBs with invalid SSL configs, security groups set to "0.0.0.0/0",
 	  KMS keys without rotation enabled, etc. 
	- Terrascan scan outputs violations such as http port open to internet, AWS CloudWatch log group not encrypted, etc. 
        - Checkov scans comprise of credentials scans and resource scans. 
 	  Credentials scans check for vulnerabilities such as hardcoding credentials into Terraform configuration, EC2 data
          or even in serverless lambda functions, while resource scans check for vulnerabilities such as too permissive IAM policies,
          security groups setting to "0.0.0.0./0", S3 bucket allowing WRITE permissions to everyone, etc. 
        

b. Tools to scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities. 
	- Anchore
	- Sysdig 

   Example of compliance violations or vulnerabilities:  
	- Anchore scan can check for OS vulnerabilities such as vulnerabilities against operating system packages (RPM, DPKG, APK, etc.)
	- Sysdig can detect container misconfigurations such as exposing insecure ports (e.g. ssh port 22 that shouldn't be open
	  on containers), inadvertently including private files via a bad COPY or ADD statement, leaking secrets or credentials, etc. 


c. Tools to scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.
	- Cloud Custodian 
	- Prisma Cloud

   Example of compliance violations or vulnerabilities: 
	- Cloud Custodian can check if a firewall rule is in place or perform early detection of obsolete snapshots, etc. 
	- Prisma Cloud can check whether RBAC rules are not too permissive, or if sensitive information is provided in environment
	  variables, or whether image is not updated to latest, etc.
