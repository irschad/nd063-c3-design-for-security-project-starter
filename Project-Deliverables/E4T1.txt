Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet.

1. Do not allow SSH at port 22 from public internet. 
   Rather, allow SSH only from trusted sources.
2. Disable root user's access via SSH by editing /etc/ssh/sshd_config file. 


Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket;
even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?

=> Grant specific role-based access to buckets which need to be accessible (free recipe bucket in this case) which'll prevent access to
   secret recipes bucket as it won't be defined accessible as per the custom IAM role policy. 
   Avoid giving instances access to all S3 buckets.
   Also, let the role policy grant only required level of access such as certain read-only operations.
   Enable S3 encryption to protect data.
